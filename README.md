# MovieApp

This movie app lets you search for movie titles.  In the initial
view, enter search criteria.  Press the Find Movies button to
go to a table view of movie titles which meet the criteria.
Touching any of the titles displays a poster for the movie, if there
is one.  If there is no poster available, you get a wonderful
blank image.

The files in this repository should be downloaded into a directory
named MovieApp.
